<h2>Features</h2>

<br>

The pages have been designed to feature a responsive navigational bar with placing of logo at the top left, the index page being the exception to the rule with the logo in the center of its page.  The footers of every page has the copyright information and social media icons that will take a visitor to photographers' social media pages.

The index page features muted looped snippets of black and white video footage presumably taken by the photographer and its purpose is to grab attention and give an emotional response to the viewer.

<h4>Index</h4>
The Index/Home page as mentioned earlier features a special video that autoplays and loops on mute. This is also the case with all viewports and devices as it aims to maintain that emotional response regardless of where it is viewed. 

There is a simple <b>Next</b> button that ushers the viewer into the <b>Gallery</b> section of the website. 

The Home/Index page promotional video was put together by the writer sourced from different videos (all copyrights reserved)from a free video downloadable website and edited with iMovie a video editing software.  


<h4>Gallery</h4>
The Gallery page has been laid out in columns of thumbnail images, 1 column wide for mobile devices, 4 columns wide for tablets and 5 columns wide for desktop. Each thumbnail features a photograph by the photographer.

These photographs have been downloaded from www.unsplash.com (all copyrights reserved) credit to the different owners whose names are listed on each corresponding image file and on the credits section of this documentation. Due to their high resolution the images had to be  reduced to make them download quickly over the internet.

Viewing the images in full is much preferred option as it gives a better user experience. Every thumbnail image can be clicked to open a Fancybox window to view the artwork in more detail and to perform other tasks such as move to the next image,view the previous, or return to the gallery page.


<h4>About</h4>
The About page features a  photograph of the photograper. The about page also includes some brief history about the photographer, providing enough information to satisfy curiosity without bombarding the user with information.

At the bottom of the page just above the footer are three media players further showcasing interviews with the photographer thus providing a bit more information to help the listener connect with the photographer.  


<h4>Contact</h4>
The Contact page features a contact form, which requests client name and email, provides a place to leave a message potentially requesting a quote or simply getting intouch with the photographer.

The bottom of the form contains a Send Button

<h3>Features to Implement in future</h3>
Future implementations will include making the contact form functional as it is currently static, this will involve the back-end development of the website.

Lastly that the social media icons will link to the photographers social media pages.
